GDevelop is a full-featured, open-source game development software, allowing to create desktop and mobile games without any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.

## ONLY THE ANDROID VERSION IS INCLUDED IN THIS REPOSITORY

This is a mobile version for [Facebook instant game developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) that launches the GDevelop game engine from your phone allowing you to develop instant games on the go. Although the app is fully operational it's not meant to be a final product but a functional demo or mvp meant for Florian Rival and the GDevelop community in general in case they ever choose to go down the mobile route.

## Why GDevelop Mobile?

[Studies](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/) claim that Facebook with its many apps and functionalities is synonymous with the entire internet in some parts of the world, and users in 3rd world countries use their phones the same way the rest of us use our desktop computers. Facebook allows users to publish games on its platform but it doesnâ€™t provide any usable game engines (let alone for mobile) so this is where GDevelop comes into play.

The engine has a very convenient browser version but no mobile apps in the making, therefore as a member of the GDevelop community myself I took the liberty of transforming the existing browser functionality into a working mobile app to showcase the merits of a possible GDevelop Mobile edition. If someone who lives in a household with only a cheap smartphone at their disposal can use this to make fun games then that's a cool thing to have out there in the world, plus it promotes the democratization of Facebook's developer tools. The best part is that GDevelop is free and easy, with no entry barriers for aspiring developers.
