GDevelop is a full-featured, open-source game development software, allowing to create desktop and mobile games without any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.

This is a mobile version for [Facebook instant game developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) that launches the GDevelop game engine from your phone allowing you to develop instant games on the go. Although the app is fully operational it's not meant to be a final product but a functional demo or mvp meant for Florian Rival and the GDevelop community in general in case they ever choose to go down the mobile route.

## Why GDevelop Mobile?

I read an eye-opening [study](https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/) that claims Facebook is synonymous with the internet in some parts of the world and how users in 3rd world countries use their phones the same way the rest of us use our computers. Why leave these parts of the world out and not give them a chance to become fully-fledged game developers by using Facebook’s developer tools? Facebook allows users to publish games on its platform but it doesn’t provide any usable game engines so this is where GDevelop comes into play. 

I noticed that the engine has a browser version but no mobile apps in the making, so as a member of the open source community myself I took the liberty of transforming the existing browser functionality into a working mobile app to showcase the merits of a possible GDevelop Mobile Edition. If someone who lives in a household with only a cheap smartphone at their disposal can use this to make games then that's a cool thing to have out there in the world. The best part is that GDevelop is free and easy, with no entry barriers for aspiring developers in underdeveloped countries.
